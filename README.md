# Building Achievements in Unity
A repository to work through the "How to Build In-Game Achievements in Unity" series by Jimmy Vegas published on YouTube.


## Description of Assets
Game will use C# coding with scripts originally copied from the tutorial vidoes and updated by myself where needed.  Assets will either be ones I created or will not be included in this repository due to licensing requirements.

## Project Status
Most recent video completed is Video 2.  The first two achievements have been coded and implemented.  NOTE: Due to licensing requirements, the achievement sounds have not been implemented in game with the line of code that actually plays the sounds  commented out.


## To-Do List:
- Continue with YouTube playlist and add more in-game achievements
- Refactor the achievement code to eliminate duplicative achievement code
- Find sounds with a license that allows for distribution to include in project
- Implement the follow-up to the LevelComplete Achievement where it switches to the next scene

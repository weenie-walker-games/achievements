# achievements
A repository to work through the "How to Build In-Game Achievements in Unity" series by Jimmy Vegas published on YouTube.

Game will use C# coding.  Assets will either be ones I created or will not be included in this repository due to licensing requirements.

Project Status:
Most recent video completed is Video 1.  At this point, the notification template for in-game achievements has been built in the scene.

Additionally, the first achievement has been coded and implemented.  NOTE: Due to licensing requirements, the achievement sounds have not been implemented in game, but the code is there with the actual playing of the sounds commented out.


To-Do List:
- Continue with YouTube playlist and add more in-game achievements
- Refactor the achievement code to eliminate duplicative achievement code
